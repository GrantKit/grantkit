## Partnership Model

PolicyEngine is fully aligned with RAF's vision:

- **Open source:** All tools under AGPL/MIT. Any state can fork and deploy. See [github.com/PolicyEngine](https://github.com/PolicyEngine).
- **Low-cost scaling:** Work for one state immediately benefits others.
- **Public availability:** [policyengine.org](https://policyengine.org) is already public-facing.
- **Co-development:** We need state input to validate what our tools surface against administrative reality.

**Data needs from states:** Statutory and administrative codes (typically public), agency guidance documents, and feedback on which flagged provisions are real burdens vs. necessary requirements.
