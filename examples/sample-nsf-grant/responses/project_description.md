# Project Description

## Introduction

Policy decisions affect millions of households, yet the tools to analyze
these effects remain inaccessible to most stakeholders. This project
addresses this gap by developing open-source infrastructure for policy
analysis that is accurate, transparent, and accessible.

## Goals and Objectives

1. **Develop Core Infrastructure**: Build a modular microsimulation engine
   that can model tax and benefit policies across multiple jurisdictions.

2. **Create User Interfaces**: Develop web-based tools that make policy
   analysis accessible to non-technical users.

3. **Build Community**: Establish an open-source community around the
   tools, including documentation, tutorials, and contributor guidelines.

## Technical Approach

### Architecture

The system uses a layered architecture:

- **Data Layer**: Ingests and harmonizes household survey data
- **Simulation Layer**: Applies policy rules to calculate outcomes
- **API Layer**: Exposes calculations via REST endpoints
- **Presentation Layer**: Visualizes results for end users

### Implementation

We will use Python for the core simulation engine, React for the
web interface, and standard cloud infrastructure for deployment.
All code will be MIT licensed and hosted on GitHub.

## Timeline

- **Year 1**: Core engine development and initial policy coverage
- **Year 2**: Web interface and API development
- **Year 3**: Community building and sustainability planning

## Intellectual Merit

This work advances the field by:

1. Creating reusable components for policy microsimulation
2. Establishing best practices for open-source policy tools
3. Enabling reproducible policy research

## Broader Impacts

The broader impacts include:

1. **Education**: Training materials for computational policy analysis
2. **Accessibility**: Free tools for under-resourced organizations
3. **Transparency**: Open methodology for policy decisions
