## Indicative Cost and Timeline

These estimates assume we're extending our existing 50-state infrastructure to RAF's diagnostic use case—work we haven't done before, but which builds on proven architecture.

| Scope | Timeline | Cost |
|-------|----------|------|
| **Pilot** (2-3 programs, e.g., SNAP + Medicaid eligibility procedures) | 6-9 months | $200,000-300,000 |
| **Expanded** (5-7 programs including housing, childcare, workforce) | 12-15 months | $400,000-500,000 |

**Subsequent states** cost less because federal rules and common patterns transfer:

| Scenario | Cost | Timeline |
|----------|------|----------|
| State 2 | $100,000-150,000 | 4-6 months |
| States 3+ | $75,000-100,000 | 3-4 months |
