# Facilities, Equipment, and Other Resources

## Computing Resources

### Cloud Infrastructure
PolicyEngine operates on Google Cloud Platform with the following resources available for this project:

- **Compute Engine**: Scalable virtual machines for microsimulation processing
- **Cloud Run**: Serverless containers for API endpoints
- **Cloud SQL**: PostgreSQL databases for user data and caching
- **Cloud Storage**: Object storage for microdata and model artifacts

Current monthly compute capacity supports 2M+ API calls; infrastructure scales automatically with demand.

### Development Environment
- GitHub Enterprise for version control and CI/CD
- GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment
- Codecov for test coverage monitoring

## Software Resources

### Existing Open-Source Infrastructure
The project builds on PolicyEngine's existing open-source codebase:

- **policyengine-core** (MIT License): Policy rules engine with 50,000+ lines of Python
- **policyengine-us** (MIT License): U.S. tax-benefit model with 100,000+ lines of Python
- **policyengine-us-data** (MIT License): Microdata calibration and enhancement tools

### External Validation Resources
Through collaboration agreements:
- NBER TAXSIM access for validation comparisons
- Policy Simulation Library Tax-Calculator for cross-validation
- Yale Budget Lab Tax-Simulator for cross-validation

## Office Space

PSL Foundation maintains remote-first operations with:
- Virtual collaboration tools (Slack, GitHub, Google Meet)
- Access to coworking spaces in Washington, DC and San Francisco as needed

## Other Resources

### Data Access
- Census Bureau Current Population Survey (public use)
- IRS Statistics of Income public use files
- State agency administrative data through partner agreements

### Documentation and Training Infrastructure
- Documentation site (docs.policyengine.org) on Netlify
- Jupyter notebook hosting for tutorials
- Video conferencing for training webinars and office hours
