Map grant.yaml fields to SF424 schema\n3. Embed PDF attachments (project description, budget justification, etc.)\n4. Validate against XSD schemas before export\n\n## Workflow\n1. Write proposal in GrantKit (markdown + YAML)\n2. Export to Grants.gov XML package\n3. Upload package to Grants.gov OR use institution's S2S system\n4.
