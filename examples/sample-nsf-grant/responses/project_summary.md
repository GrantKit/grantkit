# Project Summary

## Overview

This project develops open-source infrastructure for policy analysis,
enabling researchers and policymakers to understand the effects of
tax and benefit reforms on households across the income distribution.

## Intellectual Merit

The intellectual merit lies in creating a modular, extensible framework
that combines microsimulation modeling with modern software engineering
practices. This enables reproducible policy analysis at scale.

## Broader Impacts

The broader impacts include democratizing access to policy analysis tools,
training the next generation of computational social scientists, and
providing evidence-based insights for policy decisions affecting millions.
