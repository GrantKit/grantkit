# Broader Impacts

## Overview

This project's broader impacts extend beyond academic research to benefit
society through improved policy understanding, educational opportunities,
and democratized access to analytical tools.

## Educational Impact

### Curriculum Development

We will develop course materials for teaching computational policy analysis:

- **Undergraduate Module**: Introduction to policy microsimulation
- **Graduate Seminar**: Advanced topics in computational social science
- **Workshop Series**: Hands-on training for practitioners

### Student Training

The project will support:

- 2 PhD students in computational social science
- 4 undergraduate research assistants
- Summer internship program for underrepresented groups

## Broadening Participation

### Accessibility

All tools will be:

- Free and open source
- Documented in plain language
- Accessible via web browser (no installation required)
- Available in multiple languages

### Outreach

We will partner with:

- Community organizations serving low-income populations
- State and local government policy offices
- Nonprofit advocacy groups

## Societal Benefits

### Policy Transparency

By making policy analysis tools publicly available, we enable:

- Journalists to fact-check policy claims
- Advocates to analyze proposals affecting their communities
- Citizens to understand how policies affect their households

### Evidence-Based Decision Making

The tools will support:

- Legislative staff analyzing proposed bills
- Executive agencies evaluating program changes
- Researchers studying policy effects

## Sustainability

### Open Source Community

We will build a sustainable open-source community through:

- Clear contribution guidelines
- Regular community calls
- Annual conference/hackathon
- Mentorship program for new contributors

### Funding Diversification

Post-grant sustainability through:

- Foundation partnerships
- Government contracts for customization
- Training and consulting services
